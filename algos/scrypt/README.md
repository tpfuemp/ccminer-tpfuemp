# scrypt (`-a scrypt`, `-a scrypt-jane`)

Scrypt and scrypt-jane, relocated from the repo root (`scrypt/` folder plus the
`scrypt.cpp` / `scrypt-jane.cpp` dispatchers) into a single self-contained
`algos/scrypt/`.

> **Status: live.** Both algos were dead-dispatched for a while (the main
> scanhash switch in `ccminer.cpp` had no case for them, so `-a scrypt` could
> not mine). The dispatch cases were restored in `2dd88e1`; `ccminer.cpp`
> now calls `scanhash_scrypt` / `scanhash_scrypt_jane` like any other algo.

## Layout

Relocation only — every symbol is unchanged.

- `scrypt.cpp` — scrypt host driver (`scanhash_scrypt`).
- `scrypt-jane.cpp` — scrypt-jane host driver (`scanhash_scrypt_jane`).
- `salsa_kernel.cu` / `blake.cu` / `keccak.cu` / `sha256.cu` — the CUDA TUs.
  On Windows only these are compiled; the per-architecture kernels
  (`fermi_kernel.cu`, `kepler_kernel.cu`, `nv_kernel.cu`, `nv_kernel2.cu`,
  `test_kernel.cu`, `titan_kernel.cu`) are `#include`d into `salsa_kernel.cu`.
  On the autotools build they are compiled as separate TUs (with a special
  `compute_35` rule for `titan_kernel`).
- `code/` — the scrypt-jane portable/chacha reference headers.

## Move fixes

The two dispatchers referenced the folder with a `scrypt/` prefix
(`#include "scrypt/salsa_kernel.h"`, `#include "scrypt/code/..."`); now that they
live in the folder those were changed to own-folder paths (`"salsa_kernel.h"`,
`"code/..."`). All in-folder includes were already own-folder/`code/`-relative,
and there were no `../` or external references, so the move is otherwise
source-transparent. The `SCRYPT_KECCAK512` / `SCRYPT_CHACHA` /
`SCRYPT_CHOOSE_COMPILETIME` defines are global project settings and are
unaffected.

## Build

`ccminer.vcxproj` + `.filters` repoint the entries that exist there
(`salsa_kernel.h` + `blake`/`keccak`/`sha256`/`salsa_kernel` `.cu`); the host
`.cpp` were already absent from the Windows project and stay that way.
`Makefile.am` repoints the full source list and the `titan_kernel.o` rule.

## Validation

Run `--benchmark` and a short pool run after any change, as for every algo
(`docs/coding-guideline.md` §7). Every GPU candidate is re-hashed on the CPU
before submit.
