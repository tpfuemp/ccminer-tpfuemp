# lyra2 family (`-a lyra2`, `-a lyra2v2`, `-a lyra2z`, `-a lyra2z330`)

Lyra2-based coins, tpruvot lineage, GPLv3.

- `lyra2RE.cu` — `scanhash_lyra2` (Lyra2RE): blake256 → keccak256 → lyra2 →
  skein256 → groestl256.
- `lyra2REv2.cu` — `scanhash_lyra2v2` (Lyra2REv2): blake256/keccak (fused
  `blakeKeccak256`) → cubehash256 → lyra2v2 → skein256 → cubehash256 → bmw256.
- `lyra2Z.cu` — `scanhash_lyra2Z` (Lyra2Z): blake256 → lyra2Z.
- `lyra2Z330.cu` — `scanhash_lyra2z330` (Lyra2Z330, Gravity/GXX): Lyra2 alone over
  the 80-byte header, `timeCost 2 / 330 rows / 256 cols`. See below.

CPU references: `Lyra2.c`/`.h`, `Lyra2Z.c`/`.h`, `Sponge.c`/`.h`, also included by
allium, x21s and evohash via `algos/lyra2/Lyra2.h`.

Lyra2REv3 is not present (it was never wired up); see git history if it is wanted.

## Layout

The Lyra2 **matrix primitives** live in `algos/stages/` (`cuda_lyra2.cu`,
`cuda_lyra2v2.cu`, `cuda_lyra2Z.cu`, `cuda_lyra2Z330.cu` + `cuda_lyra2_vectors.h`),
the dispatchers and CPU references here. The stage launchers keep their
`lyra2*_cpu_*` names because they are co-owned with allium/x21s/evohash, which reach
them via `extern`.

Two shared device headers:

- `cuda/blake2b_device.cuh` — the reduced-round BLAKE2b permutation all four stages
  use: `Gfunc`, the warp shuffles, both `round_lyra` layouts (4-lanes-per-hash
  `uint2[4]`, single-thread `uint2x4[4]`) and the quad-scoped variants z330 needs.
- `cuda/lyra2_device.cuh` — the shared-memory row ops (`LD4S`/`ST4S`,
  `reduceDuplex`, `reduceDuplexRowSetup`, `reduceDuplexRowt`), macro-driven off the
  includer's `Nrow`/`Ncol`/`memshift`/`BUF_COUNT`. Used by lyra2 and lyra2z (both
  8 × 8, memshift 3, BUF_COUNT 0).

The row ops are not shared further: **lyra2v2** uses flat-indexed unrolled
accessors (`ST4S(index, data)`, `reduceDuplexRowSetupV2`) rather than (row, col)
ops, and **lyra2z330** streams a global matrix, so its accessors take the matrix
pointer and interleave by thread. The `blake2b_IV` tables likewise stay per-TU —
v1/v2 `__constant__`, Z kernel-local `const`, z330 a lane-indexed `uint2` view.

The build floor is sm_61, so the stages carry no arch guards, no pre-`__shfl`
shuffle emulation and no `cuda_arch`/`device_sm` dispatch. `lyra2_cpu_hash_32` /
`lyra2_cuda_hash_64` keep a vestigial `gtx750ti` parameter (public signature).

The 256-bit primitives this family shares with Algo256
(`blake256`/`bmw256`/`cubehash256`/`groestl256`/`skein256`) are still family-branded;
a family-wide de-brand is possible now that both trees are migrated.

## lyra2z330

Two differences from lyra2z:

- **No prehash.** lyra2z blake256's the header and feeds Lyra2 32 bytes; lyra2z330
  feeds it the raw 80-byte header as *both* password and salt.
- **330 rows is not a power of 2.** Lyra2's Wandering phase picks rows with
  `state[0] & (nRows-1)` in the classic code, which only holds for a power-of-2
  `nRows`; `Lyra2Z.c` uses the generic modulo form, as both reference miners do.
  Taken on the *unsigned* value it is bit-identical to the mask for power-of-2
  `nRows` (including the negative-step wrap), so lyra2z is unaffected.

`LYRA2Z_reuse` takes a caller-owned matrix so the hashing loop does not allocate
~7.7 MB (330 × 256 × 96 B) per hash; `LYRA2Z` is the one-shot wrapper. Neither
pre-zeroes the matrix — Setup writes every row before it can be read.

### GPU kernel (`algos/stages/cuda_lyra2Z330.cu`)

The other matrix stages hold the whole matrix in shared memory (~3 KB per hash);
7.7 MB cannot fit, so this one keeps it in global memory and **streams** it — the row
operations walk a row column by column with only the 16-word sponge state live.
Everything is one launch: absorb → rows 0/1 → Setup → Wandering → wrap-up → squeeze.

Lane split as in `cuda_lyra2.cu`: the blake2b state is a 4 × 4 `uint2` matrix and
lane L owns column L (sponge words {L, 4+L, 8+L, 12+L}), so the 12-word bitrate is
`state[0..2]` and a 96-byte matrix column is 3 `uint2` per lane. Row operations and
the `rotW` cross-lane rotation are transcribed from `cuda_lyra2.cu`.

Specific to this kernel:

- Matrix layout is lane-interleaved, `((3·(256·row + col) + j)·threads + thread)·4 +
  lane`: a quad hits 4 consecutive `uint2` (64 B) and consecutive hashes are
  adjacent, so a warp covers 512 contiguous bytes.
- **No `__ldg` on matrix loads** — the same kernel writes the matrix, and the
  read-only cache is not coherent with those writes.
- **Shuffles are quad-scoped** (`0xf << (laneid & ~3)`), not full-warp: a tail quad
  must exit on the thread-count guard (matrix slots are per-quad, so it cannot clamp
  onto a neighbour's), which leaves the warp partly inactive, and a `__shfl_sync`
  mask naming exited threads is undefined behaviour.

Throughput is bounded by VRAM, not by the kernel: `scanhash_lyra2z330` derives it
from `cudaMemGetInfo` (192 MB reserved, rounded to whole blocks) and `-i` may only
lower it. 72 registers, 0 spill.

### Measured rates

| | rate |
|---|---|
| CPU reference, 1 thread (`LYRA2Z_reuse`, gcc -O2) | ~437 H/s (2.29 ms/hash) |
| GPU, RTX 3060, 1376 concurrent hashes | ~4.48 kH/s |
| GPU, live on zpool (auto-sized 1408 threads, 10.6 GB) | ~4.37–4.56 kH/s, 108–124 W |

Flat past ~1024 concurrent hashes, i.e. **at the DRAM roofline**: ~87 MB of traffic
per hash (the Wandering phase read-modify-writes both `M[row]` and `M[row*]`) ×
4.5 kH/s ≈ 390 GB/s on a ~360 GB/s card. Occupancy and launch-shape knobs are dead
levers; only less traffic would help, and the algorithm fixes that. One launch is
~307 ms — inside the Windows TDR window, but it also sets the job-switch latency.

### Validation

Ground truth: cpuminer-opt (`algo/lyra2/lyra2z330.c`) and KlausT ccminer
(`lyra2/lyra2Z330.cu`), which agree bit-for-bit. Header `00..4f` ⇒
`bbc07308856eef2305237fd2aa662c6573d2e173fddee568788bc30048d54ab0`, embedded as the
init-time self-test with a bit-flip negative check; lyra2z's own shape
(`8/8/8`, input `00..1f`) ⇒ `7bf350a4…`, unchanged by the modulo switch.

`lyra2z330_gpu_selftest` compares the kernel against the CPU reference over 4 nonces
at init, and every candidate the on-device screen reports is re-hashed on the host
before submit.

**Live** on zpool: 50/51 accepted, 0 does-not-validate, 14 blocks in ~6.5 min. The
non-accepted share was `Invalid job id` — stale at a job rollover (the ~307 ms launch
granularity), not a bad hash.
