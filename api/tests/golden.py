"""Golden-output capture for the binary API.

Sends every command the API implements to a running miner and records the exact
bytes it replies with. Used as a regression gate: capture before a change,
capture after, diff. The binary protocol is a compatibility surface, so any
diff that is not explicitly intended is a defect.

    ccminer --api-bind 127.0.0.1:4068 -a <algo> --benchmark
    python api/tests/golden.py capture before.txt
    ...change something, rebuild...
    python api/tests/golden.py capture after.txt
    python api/tests/golden.py diff before.txt after.txt

Replies are recorded verbatim except for the volatile fields listed in VOLATILE,
which change between two runs of the *same* binary (uptime, temperatures, rates)
and would otherwise drown the signal. `diff` reports those separately so a real
change inside a masked field is still visible as a count.
